1. Introduction and Context (Quentin)
   
“Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Coral reefs, often referred to as the ‘rainforests of the sea,’ are critical ecosystems that support over 25% of marine biodiversity. However, these vital ecosystems are disappearing at an alarming rate due to climate change, pollution, and human activity. Today, we are excited to introduce EcoReef 3D, an innovative solution designed to support coral regeneration using cutting-edge 3D printing technology. By addressing this pressing issue, we hope to play a part in preserving marine life for future generations.”

2. Problem Statement and Impact (Alix)
   
“Coral reefs are under significant threat worldwide. More than half of the world’s coral reefs have already been destroyed, and scientists predict that nearly 90% of them could disappear by 2050. The loss of coral reefs not only impacts marine life but also millions of people who rely on them for food, income, and coastal protection. Traditional restoration methods are often time-consuming and leave artificial structures behind. This is where EcoReef 3D steps in, offering a sustainable and eco-friendly approach to tackle this global challenge.”

3. Technical Innovation: EcoReef 3D (Ethan)
   
“EcoReef 3D is a state-of-the-art 3D printer that creates biodegradable structures to support coral regeneration. What makes this technology unique is its ability to analyze the specific environmental conditions of a reef, such as water temperature, salinity, and biodiversity. Using this data, the printer designs coral prosthetics that seamlessly integrate into the marine environment. The materials used, like calcium carbonate, mimic the natural structure of corals, ensuring compatibility with marine ecosystems. These prosthetics provide a temporary framework for coral growth and biodegrade naturally over time, leaving no artificial waste behind. This innovation not only restores coral reefs but also ensures long-term sustainability.”

4. Funding the Project (Adrien)
   
“EcoReef 3D needs money to become real. We will ask governments to help because coral reefs are important for tourism and the environment. We also want private companies to invest, especially those that care about saving nature we'll need around 500,000 $ for researches and we count 25,000 $ per printer . To involve everyone, we plan to use crowdfunding so people who care about the planet can support us. Finally, we will apply for grants and funds for environmental projects. This mix of funding will help EcoReef 3D succeed.”

5. Conclusion and Call to Action (Lou)
   
“In conclusion, EcoReef 3D is a new way to save coral reefs using 3D printing. It helps the ocean and keeps the environment clean. We believe that this solution can make a big difference. Thank you for listening, and we hope you will join us in protecting our oceans and marine life.”
